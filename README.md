# ToneClone Claude Code Plugin

Generate content in your authentic voice — directly from Claude Code, trained on your actual writing style.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add toneclone/claude-code-plugin
/plugin install toneclone@toneclone
```

## What It Does

ToneClone trains on your writing samples and generates content that sounds like *you* — not generic AI. Use it for:

- Drafting emails and messages
- Writing social posts
- Creating marketing copy
- Any written communication in your voice

## Prerequisites

A ToneClone account is required. Sign up free at [toneclone.ai](https://toneclone.ai).

## Usage

Once installed, just ask Claude to write something:

> "Draft a follow-up email to my client about the project timeline"

> "Write a tweet announcing our new feature"

> "Reply to this message in my casual style: [paste message]"

Or use the `/write` command directly.

Claude will automatically use your ToneClone personas and knowledge cards to generate content in your voice.

### First Time Setup

If you haven't set up ToneClone yet, Claude will walk you through:

1. Installing the ToneClone CLI
2. Authenticating with your API key
3. Creating your first persona
4. Adding training samples from your writing
5. Setting up knowledge cards with your context
